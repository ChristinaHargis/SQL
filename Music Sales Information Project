--For this project, I worked with a database containing 11 tables of information about songs, customers, invoices, employees, sales, 
  and other related information. The following is code that I wrote in SQLite to gather data from the tables.
  
  

--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT customers.FirstName, 
customers.LastName, 
customers.CustomerId, 
customers.Country FROM customers
  WHERE Country != "USA";



--Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT customers.FirstName, 
customers.LastName, 
customers.Country FROM customers
  WHERE Country = "Brazil";



--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, 
  Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT customers.FirstName, 
customers.LastName, 
customers.Country, 
invoices.InvoiceId, 
invoices.InvoiceDate, 
invoices.BillingCountry FROM customers
  LEFT JOIN invoices
  ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
  WHERE BillingCountry = "Brazil"
  ORDER BY customers.LastName;



--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT employees.LastName, 
employees.FirstName, 
employees.Title FROM employees
  WHERE Title LIKE ("Sales%Agent");



--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT invoices.BillingCountry FROM invoices;



--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT employees.LastName, 
employees.FirstName, 
employees.Title, 
invoices.InvoiceId FROM employees
  LEFT JOIN customers
  ON employees.EmployeeId = customers.SupportRepId
  LEFT JOIN invoices
  ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
  WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";
  
  

--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT employees.LastName AS Employee_Last_Name, 
employees.FirstName AS Employee_First_Name, 
employees.Title AS Employee_Title,

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.

SELECT tracks.Name AS Track_Name,

--Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT tracks.name AS Track_Name,
