The following is SQL code I wrote while going through the SELECT from WORLD tutorial on SQL Zoo (SQLZOO.NET)


/* the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million */

SELECT name, gdp/population FROM world
WHERE population >= 200000000;

/* name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America' */

SELECT name, population/1000000 FROM world 
WHERE continent = 'South America';

/* name and population for France, Germany, Italy */

SELECT name, population FROM world 
WHERE name IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy'); 

/* countries which have a name that includes the word 'United' */

SELECT name FROM world 
WHERE name LIKE '%United%';

/* countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area */

SELECT name, population, area FROM world 
WHERE (area > 3000000 AND population <= 250000000) OR 
(area <= 3000000 AND population > 250000000);

/* name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places */

SELECT name, 
ROUND(population/1000000, 2), 
ROUND(gdp/1000000000, 2) 
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'South America';

/* Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000 */

SELECT name, ROUND(((gdp/population)/1000)*1000, -3) FROM world 
WHERE gdp >= 1000000000000;

/* Show the countries and capitals that have the same number of characters */

SELECT name, capital
  FROM world
 WHERE LEN(name) = LEN(capital);
 
/* Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word. */

SELECT name, capital FROM world
WHERE (LEFT(name, 1) = LEFT(capital, 1)) 
AND (name != capital);

/* Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name */

SELECT name FROM world 
WHERE name LIKE '%a%' AND
name LIKE '%e%' AND 
name LIKE '%i%' AND 
name LIKE '%o%' AND 
name LIKE '%u%' AND 
name NOT LIKE '% %';
