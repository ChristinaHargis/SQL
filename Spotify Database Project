# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.

# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.

# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.


#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL
)


#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.


--How many times does Bad Bunny appear on the list?

SELECT COUNT(artist_name) FROM Spotifydata
  WHERE artist_name = "Bad Bunny";


--What are the 5 most popular tracks?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity from Spotifydata
  ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 5;


-- What is the average danceability of all the songs?

SELECT avg(danceability) FROM Spotifydata;


--Who is the artist that shows up the most on the list?

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) AS value_occurrence FROM Spotifydata
   GROUP BY artist_name
  ORDER BY value_occurrence desc LIMIT 1;


--Which song is the longest?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms) FROM Spotifydata;
