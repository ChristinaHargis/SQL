In this exercise, I was querying a bigquery_public_data set called london_bicycles. 




/* What are the names of the stations that bike_id 1710 started from? */

SELECT start_station_name FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
  WHERE bike_id = 1710;

/* How many bike_ids have ended at "Moor Street, Soho"? */

SELECT COUNT(bike_id) FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
WHERE end_station_name = "Moor Street, Soho";

/* What is the station_id for "Canton Street, Poplar"? */

SELECT end_station_id FROM bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire
WHERE end_station_name = "Canton Street, Poplar"
GROUP BY end_station_id;


/* What is the name of the station whose ID is 111? */

SELECT end_station_name FROM bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire
WHERE end_station_id = 111
GROUP BY end_station_name;


/* How many distinct bike_ids had trip durations greater than 2400 seconds (or 40 minutes)? */

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT bike_id) FROM bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire
WHERE duration > 2400;
