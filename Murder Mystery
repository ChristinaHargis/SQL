The following SQL code was written by me to solve the mystery on https://mystery.knightlab.com/


--First, find the relevant crime scene report for a murder taking place on Jan 15, 2018 in SQL City 

SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = 20180115 AND city = "SQL City" AND type = "murder";

--Find the two witnesses.

SELECT * FROM person
	WHERE name LIKE "Annabel %" AND address_street_name = "Franklin Ave"
  
SELECT * FROM person
	WHERE address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr"
	ORDER by address_number desc LIMIT 1;
  

--Interview the two witnesses.

SELECT person.name, interview.transcript FROM person
JOIN interview
ON person.id = interview.person_id
WHERE person.name = "Annabel Miller" OR person.name = "Morty Schapiro"


--Narrow down the possible suspects based on gym check in date, membership status, and membership id clues. 

SELECT get_fit_now_member.name,
get_fit_now_member.membership_status, 
get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id, 
get_fit_now_check_in.check_in_date FROM get_fit_now_check_in
JOIN get_fit_now_member
ON get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id = get_fit_now_member.id
WHERE check_in_date = 20180109 AND membership_status = "gold"
AND membership_id LIKE "48Z%"


--Now, find out which of the two men we found has the license plate mentioned in the witness interview.

SELECT person.name, drivers_license.plate_number 
FROM drivers_license
JOIN person
ON drivers_license.id = person.license_id
WHERE plate_number LIKE "%H42W%" 
AND name = "Jeremy Bowers" OR name = "Joe Germuska"


-- Now that we know the killer, interview him. 

SELECT person.name, interview.transcript FROM person
JOIN interview
ON person.id = interview.person_id
WHERE name = "Jeremy Bowers"


--He says he was hired by someone and gives a description. Use the description to narrow down her name. 

SELECT person.id, 
person.name, drivers_license.height, 
drivers_license.hair_color, 
drivers_license.gender, 
drivers_license.car_make, 
drivers_license.car_model FROM drivers_license 
JOIN person
ON drivers_license.id = person.license_id
WHERE height BETWEEN 65 AND 67 
AND hair_color = "red" 
AND car_make = "Tesla" 
AND car_model = "Model S"


-- Now find which of those women attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

SELECT facebook_event_checkin.person_id, 
facebook_event_checkin.event_name, 
facebook_event_checkin.date, 
person.name FROM facebook_event_checkin
JOIN person
ON facebook_event_checkin.person_id = person.id
WHERE name = "Red Korb" OR name = "Regina George" 
OR name = "Miranda Priestly" AND event_name = "SQL Symphony Concert"
AND date LIKE "201712%"
